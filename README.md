# Learn oauth2 part 2

I was follwing [this tutorial](https://riteshshergill.medium.com/create-your-own-oauth-server-with-node-js-075023722edb), but now I'm going to do it another way.

## Environment variables

```bash
# Client id and secret
CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3020
```
